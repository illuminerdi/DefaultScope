<h1>DefaultScope</h1>

<p>
	The DefaultScope plugin seeks to add the functionality of Rails' <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html#M002313">ActiveRecord::Base&#35;default_scope</a> to Wheels. While you can use <code>set()</code> right now in Wheels to alter the global defaults of the <code>findAll()</code> method, you can't set a scope for individual models. With this plugin, you can specify default values for the <code>findAll()</code> method on a specific model.
</p>

<p>
	This plugin overrides the <code>findAll()</code> method and adds a new method called <code>defaultScope()</code>.
</p>

<h2>New Methods</h2>
<ul>
	<li>defaultScope([ <em>where, order, select, distinct, include, maxRows, page, perPage, count, handle, cache, reload, parameterize, returnAs, returnIncluded</em> ])</li>
</ul>

<p>
	This method is mixed in to your Models and is meant to be invoked from the <code>init()</code> method. It takes all of the same optional arguments as the <code>findAll()</code> method, and will set them as defaults for future calls to that method.
</p>

<pre>
	&lt;!--- in any model ---&gt;
	&lt;cffunction name="init"&gt;
		&lt;!--- assume we have a model containing user information, and
		you want to sort by the last name then first for most of your
		findAll() requests.  ---&gt;
		&lt;cfset defaultScope(order="lastName, firstName") /&gt;
	&lt;/cffunction&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Overridden Methods</h2>
<ul>
	<li>findAll()</li>
</ul>

<p>
	While this method has been overridden in order to accommodate the new defaultScope settings, it still behaves the same as it did before. Use it the way you normally would. Just remember that you might have set some values in the <code>defaultScope()</code>. If you set new values for the same parameters here, those values will override the values set in <code>defaultScope()</code>.
</p>

<h2>How to Use</h2>

<p>Install it! Then the new method is automatically available to you.</p>

<h2>Uninstallation</h2>

<p>All you need to do is delete the <tt>/plugins/DefaultScope-x.x.zip</tt> file.</p>

<h2>Problems/Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
	<li>If for some reason you decide to use ordered arguments rather than named arguments, then it won't work. The new <code>findAll()</code> expects named arguments only.</li>
	<li>The plugin could do with some testing and better documentation. Also, it would probably be good to steer away from my ... unorthodox method of defining arguments for methods.</li>
	<li>There's no consideration for environment at this time. It might be a good idea to cache the values from <code>defaultScope()</code> if you're in production mode. I need to learn how to do that.</li>
</ul>
