= DefaultScope

== DESCRIPTION:

The DefaultScope plugin seeks to add the functionality of Rails' ActiveRecord::Base&#35;default_scope to Wheels. While you can use set() right now in Wheels to alter the global defaults of the findAll() method, you can't set a scope for individual models. With this plugin, you can specify default values for the findAll() method on a specific model.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

Features:
* Adds the functionality of ActiveRecord::Base#default_scope to Wheels
* defaultScope() takes all of the same options as findAll() and stores them for a specific model
* findAll() now pulls in defaultScope values and uses them if not manually overridden

Problems:
* If for some reason you decide to use ordered arguments rather than named arguments, then it won't work. The new findAll() expects named arguments only.
* The plugin could do with some testing and better documentation. Also, it would probably be good to steer away from my ... unorthodox method of defining arguments for methods.
* There's no consideration for environment at this time. It might be a good idea to cache the values from defaultScope() if you're in production mode. I need to learn how to do that.
* findAll() is used by the calculations methods (count, sum, average, etc.), which due to the SQL methods they use can't take an 'order' parameter. These methods are not making sure this parameter isn't being passed to findAll(), so this plugin now strips out the 'order' parameter before the calculations methods run. (Thanks, andybellenie, and you can see his path request for CFWheels to fix this at http://code.google.com/p/cfwheels/issues/detail?id=366)

    findAll() requests.  --->
  <cfset defaultScope(order="last_name, first_name") />
</cffunction>

== REQUIREMENTS:

* ColdFusion 8+
* CFWheels 1.0+
